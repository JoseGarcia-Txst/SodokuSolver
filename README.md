 ## Purpose
 The Purpose of this program is to introuduce the topic of Dynamic Progamming.
 This progam will compute the correct output BUT in O(n^2).
 
 ## Learned
 I learned the process of backtracking and how long it takes to compute, EX: i had input
 the "hardest Sodoku puzzle" and I got no answer. At first i stopped the code and looked for potential errors.
 Then i ran the code using a debugger ( Insane amount of steps), until came to the realization that
 every possible input is attempted ( Starting from 0 -> 9). I re-ran my code and after 10 seconds
 i got the correct answer.
 
 ## Future
 Find ways to optimize the program, maybe introducing Parallel programming.
 Create a GUI so the user can understand the process of backtracking.
